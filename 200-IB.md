## Lab 2: Building a Bot ##

1. Access the Oracle Mobile Cloud Bot Builder using the following URL.

```http://<hostname>:8080/botsui/bot```

Your Instructor will give you the Mobile Cloud host name to use
(if you are using the local Virtual Maching use *"localhost"* as the hostname)

2. Create a new Bot called ``“Café_Supremo_TD_{YOUR INITIALS}"`` and give it a
description **“Cafe Supremo Extension built by {YOUR NAME} "**

the **“Intents and Entities”** folder.

5. Import the **“Order Food.csv”** file to load a further Intent.

6. Click on each of the Intent names in the list to see the Utterances that have been associated with that given intent

Click on the “Intent Tab”

9. Try entering some input (utterance) into the message entry field at the bottom of the Chat Runtime Tester to determine what the NLP/ML had determined is your selected intent.

As suggestions; try some of the following (or make up something similar)

- “I’m really Hungry”
- "I’d like something for Lunch”
- "Good morning Mr Bot!"
- "I’d like a bite to eat"
- "bye bye!"

Confirm that the Intent is as expected.

10. Enter the following utterance

- **"I could really go for some real food"**

**NOTE:** Notice that the NLP (Natural Language Processing) was unable to explicitly determine the intent based on the current set of example phrases (corpus), though it still highlighted the best option.

11. Train the NLP engine with this additional example phrase by the following: 
- Select the Radio Button that represents the best **Intent** (in this case the **"OrderFood"** intent) and click the ''[Add Example]'' Button.
- Click the '[Train] button again, which now shows a (!) to indicate that the sample set has changed..

12. Re-Enter the previous utterance into the Tester and and again observe the determmined intent.

13. Click the Tester Play button again to remove it.

14. Click on the Entities Icon on the left hand side tool bar ( 2nd icon down )

15. Click the [More] Button and select Import “Value List” Entities

<img src="img/lab2-15.png" width="50%"/>

16. Import the **OrderFoodEntities.csv** and **YesNoEntity.csv**

17. Manually create a new Entity by Clicking on the ''[+ Entity Button]'' – Name the new Entity **“FullMenu”**

Select the **“Entity List”** option from the Configuration Drop down menu and then click into the Entities field below the dropdown list.

Choose the “Lunch” and “Snack” lists to create a “super list” entity made
up of both sub lists.

18. Go back to the Intent Tab (top Icon) and select The “OrderFood” Intent
and click on the +Entity Button in the Top Right Corner.

<img src="img/lab2-18.png" width="50%"/>

19. Scroll down the list and select the various custom Entity Definitions
(Orange Box) to add them to the intent (associating the Entity with the
Intent gives a meaningful domain on the intent/entity for the NLP to
evaluate)

20. Restart the Tester (click the RESET button if it still shows your previous
entry).

21. Enter an Utterance to see how it has evaluated the Entities with the
defined intent.

eg. **"I'd like a nice hot beef pie for lunch"**

22. Open the file **OrderFoodDialog.txt** file in the DialogYAML directory in a
text editor and select all the Text (cntrl-A)

23. Select the Dialog Tab in the left hand toolbar (3rd Icon)

<img src="img/lab2-23.png"/>

24. Delete the Default Starter BotML (YAML) code and Paste in the contents
of the **OrderFoodDialog.txt** file opened previously.

25. Click the Validate Button to Confirm that the 'cut and paste' was successful.

26. Restart the Tester and change to the “Bot” tab

27. Enter a number of Utterances to observe the flow of the Bot.

- “I’m really Hungry”
- I’d like something for Lunch”
- Can I have a chicken wrap
- I’d like a bite to eat
- Could really go for some real food
- Can I have a slice of Banana Bread with my coffee please?
