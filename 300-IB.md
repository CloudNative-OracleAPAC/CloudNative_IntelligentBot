## Lab 3: Exposing the Bot in Facebook ##

### Step1 ###

1. Login into your facebook account and create a new page from the
dropdown menu at the top right of your home page

2. Select the type of Facebook page you want by selecting one of the
options, for example "Company, Organization or Institution".
Choose the Company, Organisation or Intitution Tile and fill in the name
(while arbitrary use the same name as the Bot you created earlier)

3. you will enable your Facebook account as a Facebook Developer Account.
Go to https://developers.facebook.com and in the resulting page select
the Register button.

If you're already a registered Facebook developer, then you'll be logged in
and are ready to create an app.

Once Registered you will want to add a new Facebook App

4. In the Create a New App ID dialog enter the name MyBot_xx (where xx)
are your initials and then select a Category (Retail). The app will
represent your chatbot in Facebook. Also supply a contact email address
then click the Create App ID button. The name of this Facebook App is not
yet connected to the name of your ChatBot. You will connect your ChatBot
and the Facebook App in later steps.

5.

6. The resulting page is the Facebook App dashboard for configuring your
application. By default this typically takes you to the product page to add
various products to your application. A product represents a service that
Facebook provides. To support our bot, we will need to enable the
Messenger product and Webhook product for the page we just created.

7. Select the Dashboard menu option in the left options. The resulting page
shows you the top level information about your application of which the
App Secret key will be needed for Intelligent Bot. Select the Show button
in the App Secret field...then copy down the App Secret key and you
will use this shortly. You will have to provide your Facebook password to
view the key. Copy this value into a text editor for later.

8. Now click on the Add Product button on the left so we can add the
Messenger product. From the resulting list select Get Started next to the
Messenger item in the list.

9. In the resulting Messenger settings we need to configure the Facebook
page we created for Messenger. Part of this process is to create a Page
Access Token to help identify the page when messages are sent from your
Intelligent Bot. Scroll down to the Token Generation section, in the Page
drop down select your page. In doing this Facebook will now generate a
Page Access Token. Copy this value into a text editor for later.

### Step 2 Setup the Chatbot to use the Facebook Channel ###
1. Go back to the Bot Environment and select the Settings Tab (last icon)

2. Select the “Channels” Tab Along the top of the page.

3. Click New Channel and fill in the Dialog box that appears
Copy in both the Page Access Token and App Secret key you saved from
Facebook, into the respective fields. Finally, set the Channel
Enabled toggle to on and click the Create button.

4. In the resulting Channel definition screen, copy down the Verify
Token and Webhook URL. These will be needed on the Facebook side to
hook your ChatBot to your app.

5. Return to the Facebook App screen in your other browser tab.
Select the Messenger option in the list of Products on the left hand side,
followed by the Get Started button of the Webhooks section.

6. In the resulting New Page Subscription dialog for the Callback URL,
• copy the Webhook URL you wrote down from the Intelligent Bot channel.
• copy the Verify Token value too from the Intelligent Bot channel. In the Subscription Fields options, select the following:
o Messages
o Message_postbacks

7. Click Verify and Save

8. In the updated Messenger Settings page, under the Select a Page drop
down, select the name of the page you created earlier then select
the Subscribe button.

9. Test the Bot in Facebook by going back to your page and clicking the
Message button oh the right hand side (half way down)
