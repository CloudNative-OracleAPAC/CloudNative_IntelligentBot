### The Customer gives sufficient information in their initial request ###
Rather than have the CoffeeBot ask a lot of questions as in Scenario #1, you can give various levels of information in the initial request/statement and the bot will avoid asking redundant questions.  (Try different versions of the initial request after the hello)

- **I want a large double shot soy latte to take away. I'll do a cash pick up at the Union Square cafe in about 10 Minutes**
<img src="img/lab1-3-3-1.png" width="50%"/>

- **Write your name.**
<img src="img/lab1-3-3-2.png" width="50%"/>

- **No**
- **Thanks for the help!**
