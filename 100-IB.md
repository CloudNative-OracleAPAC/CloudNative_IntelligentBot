## Lab 1: Hands On CafeSupremo Digital Assistant ##

### Introduction ###
The CafeSupremo Digital Assistant is designed to attract new customers and to allow current customers to have a more personal interaction with the brand.  In this instance a prospective customer (Lucy) is walking down the street and has a desire for a cup of coffee.

By simply searching for the Café Supremo web page in her mobile browser (this Lab), or using a social channel, such as [Facebook Messenger](500.md), Lucy is able to access their "Virtual Barista" and quickly order the beverage she is after, and have it ready by the time she reaches the nearest Coffee Shop.

In this Lab, you will be accessing the bot to similarly order a coffee from CafeSupremo; Firstly as a prospective/new customer, then subsequently acting as a repeat and/or more knowledgeable customer of the brand.

You will see how the bot is able to interact with you as a customer, then as it learns from your past orders, how it can tailor the questions to optimise the interaction.

<img src="img/lab1-3-2-6.png" width="50%"/>

## The Customer gives sufficient information in their initial request ##
Rather than have the CoffeeBot ask a lot of questions as in Scenario #1, you can give various levels of information in the initial request/statement and the bot will avoid asking redundant questions.  (Try different versions of the initial request after the hello)

- **``"I want a large double shot soy latte to take away. I'll do a cash pick up at the Union Square cafe in about 10 Minutes"``**
<img src="img/lab1-3-3-1.png" width="75%"/>

- **Write your name.**
<img src="img/lab1-3-3-2.png" width="75%"/>

- **``"No"``**
- **``"Thanks for the help!"``**
