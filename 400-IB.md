## Lab 4 Instant Apps for Structured Data ##

### Introduction ###

While a conversational interface is a natural metaphor for interacting with the backend data and processes, the need to input a larger amount of static data makes this mechanism a lot more cumbersome and difficult as part of a Question / Answer conversation. 

Rather than being forced to respond to multiple (often repetitive) questions, each to return the appropriate data value, it would be more efficient and intuitive to use a traditional Form Style interface to input the data in a single step.

The Oracle Intelligent Bot Platform addresses this issue through the use of “Instant Apps”; which are rich, interactive widgets that can be embedded in the conversation at the point where a more sophisticated user interface is required.

By incorporating an “Instant App” into the dialogue flow, you will be able to collect the required structured data using a Form interface, that uses standard UI elements (Text Fields, Pop-Lists, Radio Buttons, Check Boxes etc.) and after any required validation, pass it back into the dialog as a single conversation step.


In this Lab Session, you will be:

 - Reviewing the “Instant App” Builder and the available UX functionality by the cloning of a template app:

<table width="50%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td align="Left">
    <ul><li><B>Design My Lunch:</B></li></ul><br>
    A simple Form style Interface to determine the customer’s preferences out of the many options available when ordering a Sandwich. <BR>
    </td>
    <td align="Center"><img src="img/lab4-intro-1a.png" width="75%"/></td>
  </tr>
<!--   
#  <tr><td cspan="2"></td></tr>
# <tr>
#    <td align="Left">
#    <ul><li><B>Give Your Feedback:</B></li></ul><br>
#    Survey Form to allow the user to rate their experience of placing an order via the Café Supremo Coffee Bot <BR>
#    </td>
#    <td align="Center"><img src="img/lab4-intro-1b.png" width="75%"/></td>
#  </tr>
-->
</table>

 - Incorporate the new "Instant Apps" into the Cafe Supremo conversation flow, through use of the **_System.Interactive_** Component, passing in relevant information from the Flow (in this case the Current User’s Name) and returning the submitted form input back into the conversation.


### Exercise Steps ###

1. Access the Oracle Mobile Cloud Bot builder UI using the following URL

http://{hostname}:8080/botsui/bot

Your instructor will give you the cloud server host name to use.

2. Click the Instant App Button in Header to open the Oracle Instant App Builder

<img src="img/lab4-2a.png" width="40%"/>

<img src="img/lab4-2b.png" width="100%"/>

3. The Builder has a number of mechanisms to start to build an “Instant App”

 - Starting with a “Blank Canvas”
 - Basing The Design on a Use Case template
 - Importing the Instant App Source File (JSON)
 - Cloning a previously Built Instant App

Click on the “New Instant App” Button to See the Create App Page.

<img src="img/lab4-3a.png" width="100%"/>

4. In this case we will start by cloning a partially complete Instant App.  So return to the Main Page by either clicking the “Back Chevron” or the link at the bottom of the Create App Page.

<img src="img/lab4-4.png" width="15%"/>

5. Scroll Down to find the “CafeSupremo : Design My Lunch” Instant App.

<img src="img/lab4-5.png" width="20%"/>

6. Click the Menu Icon (Botton Right of box) and select “Edit a Copy”

<img src="img/lab4-6a.png" width="25%"/>

<img src="img/lab4-6b.png" width="100%"/>

7. Rename the Instant App from “Copy of CafeSupremo : Design My Lunch” to “CafeSupremo : Design My Lunch [Your Initials]”

<img src="img/lab4-7.png" width="50%"/>

Take Note of the Instant App ID – you will need this value to integrate with the Bot.

8.Click on Layout Tab to show the layout of the current panel (“MySandwichOptions”) and the available UI elements.

<img src="img/lab4-8.png" width="100%"/>

9. We want to add a dressing option to the Sandwich

Drag a Checkbox below the “ChkBox_Salad” checkbox element in the MySandwichOptions pane in the left panel of the builder.

<img src="img/lab4-9.png" width="75%"/>

10. Click on the new Checkbox element and update the properties as indicated.

    <td>HONEY_MUSTARD</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td align="center">3</td>
    <td>BBQ Sauce</td>
    <td>BBQ</td>
  </tr>
</table>

19. We want the new “Choose_Dressing_Type” options to be visible when the user selects the Dressing CheckBox (and disappear when un-selected). 

Click the Events and Actions Button on App Menu to see the various Application and Element events that are defined for the application (based on what elements have been added to the App pane)

<img src="img/lab4-19.png" width="100%"/>

30.	Select the Dialog Tab in the left hand toolbar (3rd Icon) to open the Dialogue flow in the BotML Text Editor.

  <img src="img/lab4-30.png" width="10%"/>
  
31.	Scroll down to find the Conversation Step (or "State") which activates the Instant App Sandwich Wizard

 NOTE: In this case the Step is named “**designYourLunch**” and is defined as a **_System.Interactive_** component.

```
# #########################################################################################
# TEST DRIVE LAB 4 : Instant Apps for Structured ContentCustom Component 
#
# Add a Sandwich design Wizard to the conversation allowing user to specify their Sandwich
# Content.
#
# The input and subsequent Output from the Sandwich Wizard are defined in the properties
# of the system.interactive Component.
# 
# Properties
# sourceVariables : information being passed to the Instant App (in this case the userName)
# variable        : payload coming back from Instant App is copied to this variable
# ID              : The id of the Instant App to be called from the Bot.
# #########################################################################################
        
#  designYourLunch:
#    component: "System.Interactive"
#    properties:
#      sourceVariableList: userName
#      variable: lunchOrder
#      id: [ID OF YOUR INSTANT APP]  
#      prompt: "Please click on the Link below to go to the Sandwich design wizard" 

# ######################################################################################### 
```
Note: 
 --	The “sourceVariables” property is used to pass one (or a list) of values as input parameters of the Instant App.
 --	The “variable” property references a dialogue context variable to which the payload coming back from the instant app 

 - Update the ID property with the Instant App ID for your version of the Instant App
 
 eg. (eg. CafeSupremo__Design_My_Lunch_YOUR_INITIALS)

 - Remove the “Comment Hash” (#) from the beginning of each line in the designYourLunch state. (from “designYourLunch” line to the prompt: line - inclusive)
 
 32. Replace the “success” action transition in the showMenu conversation State (as used in Lab 4).  Replace “**getFoodHeatedOption**” with a reference to “**wasSandwichChosen**".
 
 This change, directs the dialogue flow to a simple test to see if the end-user selected a Sandwich from the menu.  If this is the case, the flow is directed to the "designYourLunch" instant App
 
 ```
   showMenu:
    component: "getFoodMenu"
    properties: 
      menuSlotVar: "menuItem"
      menuOption: ${menu.value}
    transitions:
      actions:
        Success: "getFoodHeatedOption"
```
convert to 

```
  showMenu:
    component: "getFoodMenu"
    properties: 
      menuSlotVar: "menuItem"
      menuOption: ${menu.value}
    transitions:
      actions:
        Success: "wasSandwichChosen"
```

33.	Run the Bot in the Test environment (within The Bot Builder) by clicking the “Play” icon in the tight corner.

 <img src="img/lab4-33a.png" width="40%"/>

 - Enter the utterance “I want some lunch”
 
 <img src="img/lab4-33b.png" width="40%"/>

 - Select a “**Sandwich**”, the choice of which will allow the user to choose the contents via the “Sandwich Design Wizard” Instant App.which  will direct the user to the “Design Your Lunch” Wizard.
 
 <img src="img/lab4-33c.png" width="40%"/>
 
 - Click the link to launch the “Instant App” created earlier.

   NOTE: as you are running the Bot within a Web interface the Instant App will open in a new browser tab. 

 <img src="img/lab4-33d.png" width="40%"/>
 
 - Add some options to the Sandwich using the form UI elements. 
 
 <img src="img/lab4-33e.png" width="40%"/>
  
 - Once having selected the desired options click the “Go Make it please!” button.
 
 <img src="img/lab4-33f.png" width="40%"/>
 
 - Having received the confirmation screen, click the [X] on the Browser Tab to Close the page.  Click back onto the Tab containing the Bot Tester.
 
   NOTE: that the values chosen in the Wizard have been passed back and are incorporated into the dialog flow.
   
 <img src="img/lab4-33g.png" width="40%"/>
   
 - Choose whether you wish to have your sandwich “warmed” and complete the Lunch Order.

 - Say goodbye to the Café Supremo Bot.

 ## Conclusion ##
 
In this Lab you:
 - Saw how easily large amounts of static data can be integrated into a Dialogue Flow via the user of an “Instant App” form interface as part of the conversation. 
 - Extended an Instant App via the integrated Instant App builder
 - Integrated the Form into the Conversation allowing for two way data exchange – from bot to form, and back again.
