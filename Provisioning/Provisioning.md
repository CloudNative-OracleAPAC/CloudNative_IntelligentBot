# ORACLE Cloud Test Drive #

## Provisioning the Digital Assistant and Mobile Backend as a Service ##

As indicated, the Cloud Test Drive (V3.0) Workshop is designed to be worked through using your own Autonomous Cloud Subscription. This allows you to perform the tasks at your own pace and return to the exercises even after the formal Workshop has completed.

It is recommended to provision the combination of the [Oracle Digital Assistant](ADA.md) & [Oracle Mobile Cloud](AM.md) services. If you are looking to implement a fixed per Hour Interaction rate please refer to the [Autonomous Mobile Cloud Enterprise](AMCE.md) steps.

**NOTE** If you are looking to provision the Intelligent Bot on a **Cloud@Customer** environment or into a Data-Centre that does not support the Autonomous Services please refer to the "[Creating an Oracle Mobile Cloud Enterprise (OMCe) Environment - Quick Start Cheat Sheet](https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/29987307-9afc-4f68-9c59-b4d10cab489a/File/88c5c0800d2c89f404bf36d856d34094/mc_omcedeploycheatsheet05_15_18.pdf)" which will walk through the additional manual steps required to provision the services in these environments.


**NOTE** Once the Digital Assistant Builder has been configured, it is necessary to import the [CafeSupremo _ Design My Lunch](CafeSupremo_DesignMyLunch.json) instant app via the "Instant App Builder" associated with the Customer Account (or GSE instance if used).
