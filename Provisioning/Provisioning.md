# ORACLE Cloud Test Drive #

## Provisioning the Digital Assistant and Mobile Backend ##

As indicated the Cloud Test Drive (V3.0) Workshop is designed to be worked through using your own Autonomous Cloud Subscription. This allows you to perform the tasks at your own pace and return to the exercises even after the formal Workshop has completed.

It is recommended to provision the combination of the [Autonomous Digital Assistant](ADA.md) & [Autonomous Mobile Cloud](AM.md) services. If you are looking to implement a fixed per Hour Interaction rate please refer to the [Autonomous Mobile Cloud Enterprise](AMCE.md) steps.
