## Provisioning the Oracle Autonomous Mobile Cloud (AMC) ##

The Oracle Autonomous Mobile Cloud (aka AMC) is the stand-alone service for the MBaaS component of Oracle's Mobile Platform.  It supports the building sophiticated Mobile Applications that utilise Mobile Platform APIs to surface such functionality as Push Notifications, Location Services, Object Storage, User Management etc as well as the development of Mobile optimised Custom APIs to access data from the Systems of Record.  When used in conjunction with the Oracle Digital Assistant, it allows for the use of "Custom Component" within the Dialogue Flow; allowing the Digital Assistant (Bot) to respond to questions and intents with live data from your back end systems. 

**Note** As a stand-alone service the Autonomous Mobile Cloud does not include the Digital Assistant for the development of the Dialogues and Specification of the NLP (Intents and Entities).  As such please also provision the [Oracle Digital Assistant](ADA.md) Service.

If you are looking to implement a non-metered Service with a static requests/Hour metric please use the steps for the [Autonomoous Mobile Cloud Enterprice](AMCE.md)

Once your account is activated simply follow the steps below to provision the Autonomous Mobile Cloud.
